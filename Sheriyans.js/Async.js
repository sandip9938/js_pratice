//  1.Sync and Async Data


// Sync 
// Synchronous is one task complete then other task start and complete as usual
// task a=45   5sec
// task b=55   10sec
// task c=58   1sec
// task d=25   4sec
// task e=15   35sec


// Async 
// Asynchronus is a carrying multiple task which is complete automatically after all tasks are completed.
 

//  2.How to know sync and async data?
// when we use setInterval,setTimeout,promises,fetch,axios,xmlht its a async. other all data is sync data.


//  3.What is async Js 
// It's an asynchronous programming model that allows you to execute code asynchronously by not blocking the main thread of execution while waiting for something like I/O



//  4.SingleThreading and multithreading 
// Single Threading: A single thread can only do one thing at the time. It means that if you have two or more things going on in
// Multithreading :
/*
Multithreading means that the CPU can execute more than one program at once (in parallel). This allows for faster processing of programs by allowing them to
Multithreading is the ability of a computer system or program to execute two or more instructions at once (in parallel). This allows for faster processing by
Multitasking means that the CPU can execute more than one program at once. The operating system schedules each process on a separate core or processor
A process can be divided into two or more threads so that it becomes parallel processing. A thread has the same access to memory space of another thread in.


//  5.Callback 
// Callback function is used for asynchronous programming in javascript. It is also known as an anonymous function or lambda expression. A callback function is passed into another.
