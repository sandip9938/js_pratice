//--------------js vs Ecmascript ------------------------
/*
   
   ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification, and JavaScript (JS) is an implementation of that specification. When comparing JS to ECMAScript, it's important to understand that JavaScript is essentially an implementation of ECMAScript. Here's a point-by-point comparison:

1. **Definition**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is the most widely used implementation of the ECMAScript specification and is primarily used in web development for client-side scripting.
   - **ECMAScript**: ECMAScript is a standardized specification for scripting languages. JavaScript, in its various versions, is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript, but other implementations like ActionScript and JScript also exist.

2. **Versions**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript is available in various versions, such as ES5, ES6 (also known as ES2015), ES2016, ES2017, and so on. These versions introduce new features and improvements.
   - **ECMAScript**: ECMAScript is versioned as well, with different editions. For example, ES6 corresponds to ECMAScript 2015, and newer editions like ES7, ES8, and so on have been released to add new features and capabilities to the language.

3. **Standardization**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript's features are largely based on the ECMAScript specification, but not all JavaScript implementations strictly adhere to all parts of the specification.
   - **ECMAScript**: ECMAScript is the standardized specification for scripting languages like JavaScript. It defines the syntax and semantics of the language, and JavaScript is the most popular implementation of this specification.

4. **Usage**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript is typically associated with web development and is mainly used in web browsers to enhance the functionality and interactivity of websites.
   - **ECMAScript**: The ECMAScript specification can be implemented in various environments beyond web browsers. It can be used for server-side development (e.g., Node.js) and even for building desktop and mobile applications (e.g., using frameworks like Electron and React Native).

5. **Features**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the practical, real-world implementation of ECMAScript, which includes various web-related features like the Document Object Model (DOM) for manipulating web pages.
   - **ECMAScript**: The ECMAScript specification defines the core features and syntax of the language. It doesn't include web-specific features like DOM, which are provided by the environment (e.g., web browsers).

6. **Implementation**:
   - **JavaScript**: JavaScript is implemented by various web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and server-side environments (e.g., Node.js) using their own JavaScript engines (e.g., V8, SpiderMonkey).
   - **ECMAScript**: The ECMAScript specification is implemented by various organizations and projects to create JavaScript engines. V8 (used in Chrome), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used in Safari) are examples of JavaScript engines that implement the ECMAScript standard.

In summary, JavaScript is the most well-known and widely used implementation of the ECMAScript specification. When developers refer to JavaScript, they are often referring to the specific features and capabilities provided by a particular version of ECMAScript, as well as the web-specific features provided by the browser environment.
